<h2 class = "headerSpacing2">Background Information</h2>
    <div>
   Outside of professional life, I enjoy music, working out, reading, and anything outdoors.<br>
    Music has always been a big part of my and have played in a few different bands. <br>
    Although, it life has picked up and I've become busy, I am hoping to get back into it. <br>
    On top of that, I try to work out 5-6 days a week to stay in shape and have loved the challenge of progressing.<br>
    At the end of the day, I always like to wind down with a good book.<br>
    And I'd never say no to a hike or a weekend outdoors.

<h2 class = "headerSpacing2">Developing</h2>
    <div>
    Professionally, I am just beginning my tech journey.<br>
    I have learned and grown a lot over the past month, but still have a long way to go. <br>
   Previously, I was in the field of education and teaching ESL abroad in Japan. <br>
   It has been an interesting and challenging journey.

<h2 class = "headerSpacing2">Hometown Life </h2>

    My hometown is called Novi and is just 30 minutes outside of Detroit.<br>
    It is home to one of the largest Asian populations in Michigan.<br>
    As a result, we can enjoy many differnt kinds of cuisine.<br>
    Being just a short drive from Detroit, we can also experience all the city has to offer.
